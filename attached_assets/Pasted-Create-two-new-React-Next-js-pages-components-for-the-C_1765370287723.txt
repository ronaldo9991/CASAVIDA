Create two new React/Next.js pages/components for the CasaVida AI platform frontend:

Page 1: “CasaVida Dubai – Luxury & Premium”
Purpose: Position CasaVida as a premium & luxury home and furniture brand in Dubai, targeting high‑income, design‑conscious customers.
Content & structure requirements:

Hero section:

Headline about CasaVida Dubai as a luxury destination for furniture and home living.

Sub‑headline mentioning Dubai, UAE, and premium lifestyle.

CTA button: “Explore Dubai Collection”.

Section: “Why Dubai Loves CasaVida”

3–4 feature cards (e.g., curated designer collections, bespoke furniture, concierge‑style service, fast delivery across UAE).

Section: “Luxury Furniture & Categories”

Grid of categories: sofas, bedroom, dining, outdoor, décor, lighting, office, etc., all positioned as premium/luxury.

Section: “Designed for Dubai Lifestyles”

Copy mentioning penthouses, villas, modern apartments, waterfront living, etc.

Emphasis on premium materials, sustainability, and elevated aesthetics.

Tone: aspirational, sophisticated, modern.

Styling:

Dark, elegant theme aligned with existing CasaVida UI (cyan / magenta / neon accent).

Use Tailwind CSS utility classes (same style as existing CasaVida frontend).

Responsive layout.

Page 2: “CasaVida India – Modern + Authentic”
Purpose: Position CasaVida in India for middle‑level and premium customers, combining authentic Indian style & culture with modern, premium design.
Content & structure requirements:

Hero section:

Headline about CasaVida India blending tradition and modern living.

Sub‑headline mentioning Indian homes, culture, and accessible premium furniture.

CTA button: “Explore India Collection”.

Section: “Authentic Indian Design, Modern Comfort”

3–4 feature cards (e.g., handcrafted details, regional design inspirations, value‑driven pricing, durable materials).

Section: “Collections Inspired by India”

Tiles for: Jaipur heritage, South Indian minimal, Mumbai urban, Delhi classic, etc.

Each tile with short description (authentic + premium).

Section: “For Middle & Premium Segments”

Clear text explaining CasaVida India serves both middle income and premium customers, with tiered options but consistent quality.

Tone: warm, cultural, yet modern and premium.

Styling:

Same design system as CasaVida (Tailwind, dark glassmorphism), but with subtle warm accent hints (e.g., amber/gold) to suggest Indian aesthetic.

Responsive layout.

Global technical requirements for both pages:

Implement as Next.js components/pages that can be imported into the existing CasaVida frontend (TypeScript + Tailwind).

Export each as a default React functional component.

Use the same header/font system as the existing CasaVida platform (assume Segoe UI and the existing gradient logo style).

Include simple navigation breadcrumbs or title at top (e.g., “CasaVida / Dubai” and “CasaVida / India”).

Avoid any backend code; purely static frontend pages ready to plug into the current app.

Return only the complete, production‑ready code for both components (Dubai and India), with no extra explanation.
